# Mobile MobileFlashcards

## A Udacity NanoDegree ANDROID Project in React Native

- To run, clone the repo and npm install
- Uses Expo. Or use an emulator of your choice
- Designed for Android; iOS may not be supported
- App ships with two default decks. Add your own decks, and add cards to any deck
- Card and deck removal are beyond the product specs, but you can clear the MobileFlashcards:deck key by refreshing the app with line 16 of Home.js *uncommented*. (Re-comment this line to resume normal use)
